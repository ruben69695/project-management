# Project Management
This is a project, to develop a simple application for project management.

# Backend
Using the power of .NET to develop the full backend of the application, all the libraries are using .NET Standard to make the backend fully crossplatform. Don't worry if you use the libraries with Linux, Mac or Windows it just works if you have .NET Core 2.1 Runtime installed on your machine.

# User Interface
In a near future, the principal idea, is make a first look with WPF technology, the problem here is that it just works for Windows systems. Otherwise, we are studying the possibilities to develop a native Android application for mobile phones.
